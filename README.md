# QuickTime-Player-Audio-Scrubber
Applescript that provides a GUI to enable 15 second scrubbing for audio files. Made this primarily for studying audio material in college.

Requires System Events access to interact with QuickTime Player. This can be accessed in System Preferences>Security & Privacy>Privacy>Accessibility and then check Script Editor.

HOW TO USE
Open an audio file in QuickTime Player and then run this AppleScript. A window will appear with three buttons, two for scrubbing forward or backward 15 seconds, and the third for exiting the AppleScript.
